1. Clock
Sketch (at least) 6 representations of time on paper. Choose 3 of the best to implement in code. Also, make 3 more with code that are variations of the examples we’ve provided, or new things that you’ve created yourself. The size should be 400 x 400 for all of them. Submitted files: Please provide all p5.js sketches as individual projects. Document any hand drawn sketches with photos, or share illustrator files.

2. Weather App
For the second and final part of the weather assignment, integrate the straightforward and conceptual versions of your weather apps into a third and final iteration.
 
Think of your audience, what information they need at a glance and what requires more detail. Think about the data that is available in the API and what is most useful to your audience. Also, consider what makes this app unique to all the other weather apps in the field. Use color, motion and interactivity to advance your concept. Please prepare to discuss all three versions, and your process for the class on Friday 9/30. The size should be 375 x 667 portrait.
